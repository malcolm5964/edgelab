Code2 (capvid.py) is a real-time motion detection program whilst Code1 (capimg.py) is a webcam snapshot program.
cv2.absdiff computes the difference between two consecutive frames to highlight changes.
cv2.cvtColor converts the difference image to grayscale for easier processing. 
cv2.gaussianBlur smooths the image to reduce noise.
cv2.threshold converts the blurred image into a binary image (black and white) to emphasize movement regions.
cv2.dilate expands white regions in the binary image to connect broken contours, making movement more distinguishable.
cv2.findContours detects outlines of objects in the thresholded image, while ignoring contours with an area smaller than 900 to eliminate minor noise.
cv2.boundingRect draws a green rectangle around detected movement regions.
cv2.putText displays "Status: Movement" on the frame when motion is detected.
cv2.imshow("feed", frame1) displays the processed video feed with detected motion.
frame1 = frame2 updates frame1 with frame2 continuously to maintain real-time motion tracking.
cv2.waitKey(40) runs the loop at approximately 25 FPS (1000/40 ms per frame) and allows the user to break the program with 'q'.
